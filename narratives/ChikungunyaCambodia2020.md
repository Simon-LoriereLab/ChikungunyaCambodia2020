#[Complete genome analysis of Chikungunya virus during the 2020 outbreak in Cambodia](https://nextstrain.org/community/Simon-LoriereLab/ChikungunyaCambodia2020@main?d=tree,map&f_country=Cambodia&p=grid&r=division)

In Cambodia, CHIKV belonging to the Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) reemerged in 2011 and cases continue to appear during the following two years. After August 2013, no CHIKV cases were detected by the national arbovirus surveillance system conducted by the Ministry of Health and the National Dengue Control Program (NDCP) in Cambodia.
In June 2020, after years of undocumented cases, novel CHIKV cases were identified and by the end of September, the outbreak had spread to 23 out of 25 provinces across the country

CHIKV captured from cases in Cambodia during the 2020 outbreak belonged to the IOL lineage.

Phylogenetic analyses show that CHIKV captured from Cambodia during 2020 are closely related to the viruses circulating in Thailand 2018-2019, China and Myanmar 2019. 
We also noted but these are sequences from cases with travel history from Thailand during 2019. 
This suggest multiple introductions in the country

By analizing these genomes, we observed no relevant geographic clustering within Cambodia.

In contrast to the CHIKV captured in 2011, viruses reported from Cambodia during 2020 lacked the substitution E1:A226V associated to increase CHIKV dissemination in Ae. Albopictus. However, they harbored two other substitutions E1:K211E and E2:V264A, similar to the viruses detected during the outbreak in Bangladesh in 2017 and Thailand in 2019
