In June 2020, years after the last detection of CHIKV in Cambodia, a Chikungunya outbreak was noted. By the end of September, cases were reported in 23 out of 25 provinces across the country.

CHIKV captured from cases in Cambodia during this outbreak belong to the IOL lineage.

Phylogenetic analyses show that CHIKV captured from Cambodia during 2020 are closely related to viruses circulating in Thailand 2018-2019, China and Myanmar 2019. 
The genetic diversity sampled suggests multiple introductions in the country.

In contrast to the CHIKV captured in 2011, viruses reported from Cambodia in 2020 lacked the E1:A226V substitution associated with an increase of CHIKV dissemination in Ae. Albopictus mosquitoes. Instead, this lineage harbors two other substitutions in the surface proteins (E1:K211E and E2:V264A). 

More analyses are ongoing!
