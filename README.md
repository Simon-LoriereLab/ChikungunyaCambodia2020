# Genomics of the outbreak of Chikungunya virus in Cambodia 2020

This repository analyzes genomes of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) circulating in Cambodia 2020 (n=73) using [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/).
The build was constructed using a total of 775 CHIKV full-length genomes encompassing the main 4 CHIKV lineages: West African (WA), Asian, East Central South African (ECSA) and Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL).The coloring option "subclade" displays the distribution of subclades within the main CHIKV lineages. 
Within the IOL lineage we highlighted the distribution of AA substitutions (E1:A226V, E1:K211E and E2:V264) that are believed to be potentially biological relevant mutations.

This work is ongoing, and is performed in collaboration with [Institut Pasteur du Cambodge](https://www.pasteur-kh.org/) (contact: Dr Veasna Duong). This work has received support from the [CREID network](https://creid-network.org/research-centers/picreid).

## Primers scheme

We provide here a short amplicon scheme developped to help sequence low concentration or partially degraded samples corresponding to the CHIKV IOL sublineage circulating in SouthEast Asia in recent years.
The primers scheme was built using [Primal Scheme](https://primalscheme.com/) and we followed the [PrimalSeq](https://www.protocols.io/view/primalseq-generation-of-tiled-virus-amplicons-for-bez7jf9n) protocol for the generation of tiled virus amplicons.
